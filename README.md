3. open project vscode or any IDE 
4.  yarn install or npm install
5.  if deploy locally make sure you have ganache-cli and truffle should be  installed globally
        if deploy on testnet (rinkeby) create ".env" file and place your memonic as 
        REACT_APP_MNEMONIC = ... and your RPC_url as REACT_APP_RPC_URL = ... (infura or any other provider)
         and without comma (;) at the end and without qoutes.
6. run "truffle develop" | for windows users you may face some error so better use wsl2-ubuntu 20.4 terminal
7. run "truffle test " 
8. IF TEST PASSES RUN  run  "truffle console --network development" to interact with contract locally   "truffle migrate --reset --compile-all" . 
(for testnet make sure to get test eth from avaiable rinkeby faucet https://faucet.rinkeby.io/ 
or any future trusted faucet.
and "run truffle migrate --reset --network rinkeby" for testnet 

### React Frontend
